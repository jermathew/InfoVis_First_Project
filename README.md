# Information Visualization First Project
First project for Information Visualization course held at Roma Tre University

## Specs
Make a json file with multivariate data: there are 10 data-points and each data-point has six quantitative variables whose values are positive. Plot this data similarly to http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/ but with Christmas trees instead of daisies. By clicking on a Christmas ball in a tree all the trees are sorted according to the variable represented by that Christmas ball. Make sure that the transitions from one representation to another take place in a fluid way with an animation.
